# New Powerup Ideas

This document lists potential ideas for new powerups to add to the Powerup Tron game.

## Concepts

*   **Invisibility:**
    *   **Effect:** Player becomes temporarily invisible (or semi-transparent) to AI snakes.
    *   **Visual:** Maybe a shimmering effect or complete transparency.
    *   **Balance:** Short duration, doesn't affect collision with walls or player.

*   **Wall Phase:**
    *   **Effect:** Player can pass through their *own* trail walls for a short duration.
    *   **Visual:** Player trail could pulse or change color slightly while active.
    *   **Balance:** Does not allow passing through opponent trails or boundaries.

*   **Reverse Controls (Trap/Debuff):**
    *   **Effect:** Spawns a pickup that, when collected by an *opponent*, temporarily reverses their left/right controls.
    *   **Visual:** Distinct, perhaps negative-looking pickup (e.g., skull icon, dark color).
    *   **Balance:** Very short duration, player needs to bait AI into collecting it.

*   **Magnet:**
    *   **Effect:** Temporarily pulls nearby pickups towards the player.
    *   **Visual:** Subtle magnetic field lines or particle effect around the player.
    *   **Balance:** Limited range and duration.

*   **Shield:**
    *   **Effect:** Allows the player to survive one collision (with trail or head-on).
    *   **Visual:** A visible shield bubble or outline around the player head.
    *   **Balance:** One-time use per pickup.

*   **Multi-Shot:**
    *   **Effect:** Fires projectiles in a spread (e.g., 3 shots forward) instead of a single shot.
    *   **Visual:** No major change needed besides firing multiple projectiles.
    *   **Balance:** Consumes multiple ammo per shot, or has limited uses.

*   **Trail Shrinker:**
    *   **Effect:** Temporarily causes the player's newly generated trail segments to be smaller or disappear faster.
    *   **Visual:** Trail segments look different or fade quickly.
    *   **Balance:** Helps navigate tight spaces but offers less protection.

*   **AI Slowdown (Area Effect):**
    *   **Effect:** Creates a temporary zone on the field that slows down any AI entering it.
    *   **Visual:** A visible ground effect (e.g., pulsing circle).
    *   **Balance:** Limited radius and duration, player is unaffected.

*   **Bomb:**
    *   **Effect:** Destroys an area instead of 1 block.

*   **Lights Off:**
    *   **Effect:** Changes lighting so players have a light on them instead of global illumination.

*   **Trail Swap (Debuff):**
    *   **Effect:** Player picks up, targets nearest AI, and temporarily swaps trail colors with them.
    *   **Visual:** Trail colors briefly flicker and swap.
    *   **Balance:** Short duration, purely cosmetic confusion, might affect player too if not careful.

*   **Ricochet Shot:**
    *   **Effect:** Player's projectiles bounce off arena boundaries once.
    *   **Visual:** Projectile path changes on boundary hit.
    *   **Balance:** Requires aiming skill, uses standard ammo.

*   **Short Teleport:**
    *   **Effect:** Instantly move the player forward a few segments (e.g., 3-4), passing through trails.
    *   **Visual:** Quick particle flash at start and end points.
    *   **Balance:** High risk/reward, could teleport into danger, consumes the pickup on use.

*   **Trail Mine:**
    *   **Effect:** Drops a stationary mine at the player's current location. Explodes after a short delay (e.g., 2 seconds), destroying a small radius of nearby trails.
    *   **Visual:** Small, distinct mine object, explosion effect.
    *   **Balance:** Player needs to drop strategically, explosion affects all trails (including player's). One mine per pickup.

*   **Confusion Cloud:**
    *   **Effect:** Creates a temporary cloud/area effect. AI entering the cloud have a chance to randomly change direction.
    *   **Visual:** Swirling particle effect cloud.
    *   **Balance:** Limited size/duration, chance-based effect on AI.

*   **Trail Heal:**
    *   **Effect:** Slowly removes the player's *oldest* trail segments over a short duration.
    *   **Visual:** Old trail segments could fade or dissolve visually.
    *   **Balance:** Helps clean up player's own clutter but doesn't affect opponents.

*   **Boost Steal:**
    *   **Effect:** When picked up, if the nearest AI currently has an active speed boost, steal its remaining duration.
    *   **Visual:** Maybe a quick particle effect moving from the targeted AI to the player.
    *   **Balance:** Situational, only works if AI has boost active, adds boost to player.

*   **Projectile Deflector:**
    *   **Effect:** For a short time, any projectile hitting the player is deflected harmlessly.
    *   **Visual:** A brief flash or ripple effect on the player's head when a projectile is deflected.
    *   **Balance:** Short duration, defensive only.

*   **Thick Trail:**
    *   **Effect:** Temporarily makes the player's trail segments slightly wider/thicker.
    *   **Visual:** Trail segments are larger.
    *   **Balance:** Creates a larger obstacle but uses more space, making navigation potentially harder for the player too.
