# TronSnake 3D - v1.1.15

**[Play Live!](https://cunya.github.io/TronSnake-Cursor-Gemini-2.5-Exp/)**

**[Issues and Fixes Log](./ISSUES_AND_FIXES.md)**

A simple 3D snake game inspired by the light cycles from Tron, built with Three.js.

This project is part of a series of experiments in LLM-assisted code generation, developed entirely through conversations with Gemini 2.5 pro exp 03-25 using the Cursor editor.

## Features

*   Classic snake gameplay in 3D.
*   Player 1 (Cyan, keyboard/touch controlled) vs multiple AI opponents (Orange/Red/Purple/Green).
*   Dynamic play area that expands when collecting green cubes.
*   Multiple power-ups with score thresholds and some with counter-based spawning:
    *   **Blue Cube (Zoom):** Grants 20 pts. Briefly zooms the player's camera out.
    *   **Pink Cube (Speed Up):** Grants 40 pts. Temporary speed boost for the collecting snake. (Score threshold: 50)
    *   **Yellow Blocks (Sparse Trail):** Grants 60 pts. Leave gaps in your trail. (Score threshold: 200)
    *   **Orange Sphere (Ammo):** Grants 80 pts. Allows player/AI to shoot trails (Spacebar/Touch). (Score threshold: 300, Spawns every 10 pickups)
    *   **White Cube (Clear Walls):** Grants 100 pts. Removes all existing snake trails. (Score threshold: 500, Spawns every 5 pickups)
    *   **Gray Octahedron (Add AI):** Grants 125 pts. Spawns a new AI opponent. (Score threshold: 1000, Spawns every 20 pickups)
    *   **Green Cube (Expand):** Grants 150 pts. Expands play area boundaries. (Score threshold: 1500, Spawns every 15 pickups)
    *   **Purple Gems (More!):** Grants 200 pts. Increases max count of some pickups & spawns 2 others. (Score threshold: 2000, Spawns every 15 pickups)
*   Visual effects for pickup collection (particle explosion, floating text).
*   Multiple AI opponents with basic pathfinding and shooting behavior.
*   Smooth camera follow, with look-back capability.
*   Pause functionality (Escape key).
*   Game automatically pauses if the browser tab loses focus.
*   Persistent Top Score tracking using `localStorage`.
*   Link to GitHub repository in the UI.

## Setup & Running

Because this project uses ES6 modules (`import` statements) for Three.js and potentially for loading assets like fonts, you cannot simply open the `index.html` file directly in your browser from the file system (`file://...`).

You need to serve the files using a local web server.

**Simple Local Server Method:**

1.  Make sure you have Python installed.
2.  Open a terminal or command prompt in the root directory of the project (where `index.html` is located).
3.  Run the command:
    *   Python 3: `python -m http.server`
    *   Python 2: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
4.  The server will start, usually indicating the address, typically `http://localhost:8000` or `http://0.0.0.0:8000`.
5.  Open your web browser and navigate to that address.

**Other Options:**

*   Use the Live Server extension in VS Code.
*   Use Node.js-based servers like `http-server` (`npm install -g http-server` then run `http-server .`).

**Font Note:**
The game currently attempts to load the `helvetiker_regular.typeface.json` font file directly from the Three.js GitHub repository URL. Ensure you have an internet connection when running.

## Dependencies

*   [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) (included via ES module imports)
